# DPSS-Efficient-Cross-Regional-Spatial-Dataset-Search
This repository contains the code for the paper "Efficient Cross-Regional Spatial Dataset Search with Kernel Density Estimation". This research proposes a dataset retrieval scheme aimed at addressing the challenge of discovering datasets with similar distribution patterns in cross-regional scenarios.

#🖼️ System Overview
The following figure illustrates the DPSS+ framework, which is bifurcated into an offline processing stage for repository indexing and an online query stage for rapid similarity retrieval.
